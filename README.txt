Just a super simple single-page responsive template built for personal sites and portfolios
(although it'd definitely work for other stuff too). Includes a contact form, pre-styled
elements, and Sass sources.

And it's for a personal blog of WangGuangxue.

you can use for pretty much whatever.


PS: Not sure how to get that contact form working? Give formspree.io a try (it's awesome).
